 Free Code Camp Role Playing Game Project


In this Free Code Camp Project I learnt fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding my own Role Playing Game. 

Whilst doing this project I learnt how to work with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.

The game is complete however, I would like to change some functions and features
in the future.

Some features I would like to change;

- Change the buttons to not repeat the same text.
- Add a dragon graphic to the window.
- Change styles.
- Add armour and other accesories to player inventory.
- Add the option of easy, normal, hard modes.
- Add more easter eggs.

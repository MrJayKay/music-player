 Free Code Camp Music Player Project


In this project I learnt essential string and array methods, such as; find(), forEach(), map(), and join(). 

In this project, I coded a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project covered fundamental concepts such as handling audio playback, managing a playlist, implementing play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle functionalities.

Some features I would like to change;

- Add a loop track feature.
- Add multiple playlists or different albums.
- Add a fast foward to allow user to skip parts of the track.
